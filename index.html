    <div>
      Mr. Reaves wants you to know: when you don't know what tag to put things
      between, use a div!
    </div>
    <!--div is multipurpose -->
    <p>
      He also wants you to know that it will look better if you use a p tag for
      real paragraphs and sentences, because it's more likely to get people to
      visit the site.
    </p>
    <!-- p is how normal people/developers put text into their page-->
    <div>
      A div (and all these tags) are really a box, and if you open Chrome(-ium)
      Dev Tools in your browser with CTRL+SHIFT+I, then you can see the boxes!
    </div>
    <div style="border-style: solid; border-color: #c0ffee; border-width: 40px">
      Everything in HTML is a box - see when you add a border with style?
    </div>
    <div style="border-style: solid; border-color: #960a0a; border-width: 40px;font-size: larger;background-color: black;color: red;">
